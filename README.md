Note from Alex:
I just got the UI setup stuff from here https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/mern-stack-tutorial. This is some template code, I just wasn't sure what else to do. 
To run the front end:
- cd to the client dir with a terminal 
- run the command: npm run dev
- In a new chrome tab, type: localhost:<whatever the npm run dev command printed here> (without the <>)and it'll load the UI.
- The UI will automatically update when you save a file in your IDE, you don't have to reload the page or rerun any commands.
